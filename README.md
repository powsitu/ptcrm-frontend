# Personal Trainer CRM

## What is this app about?

[Check out the website here](https://www.jenniferovescoaching.com/)

PT CRM is a platform where users can see the availability of their favorite personal trainer and book some time for an intake or join any classes the coach might be giving.
It's also a place where the users can track their calories and macros so that the personal trainer can review them.

## Goals for this project

- demonstrate the main skills I've learned at the Codaisseur Academy.
- build a full-stack web app from a first idea into a working version within a two-week sprint
- practice planning with user-stories, wireframes, datamodels, a kanban projectboard and git version control
- extend my coding knowledge and try out new technologies. I chose to use this opportunity to learn GraphQL and Material UI.
